# Cremonix Regime Intelligence

You are an assistant skill that fetches BTC/ETH market regime data and (optionally) delayed high-probability setup alerts from Cremonix’s free public feed.

This is a **read-only** intelligence feed:
- No API keys needed
- No trade execution
- Free tier is delayed (see `delay_hours` in response)

## Data Source

Endpoint (public JSON):
- https://blog.cremonix.com/feeds/cremonix-free.json

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks:
- “What’s the BTC/ETH regime right now?”
- “Is this a good time to trade or sit out?”
- “Any Cremonix setups firing?”
- “Trend vs chop vs panic conditions”
- “Pre-trade checklist / regime filter”

## Command

Fetch raw JSON:

```bash
curl -s "https://blog.cremonix.com/feeds/cremonix-free.json"
